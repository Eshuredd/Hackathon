## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Agent-1: Deal Scout Agent

The core agent responsible for:

- Monitoring multiple grocery platforms simultaneously
- Fetching real-time prices, discounts, and stock availability
- Analyzing combo deals and special offers
- Comparing delivery times and costs
- Generating intelligent recommendations

### Database Models

- **GroceryItem**: Individual grocery items with categories
- **GroceryPlatform**: Platform information (delivery times, fees, etc.)
- **GroceryDeal**: Real-time deals and prices
- **GroceryList**: User's shopping lists
- **DealAnalysis**: Analysis results and recommendations

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- PostgreSQL (or SQLite for development)
- Redis (for Celery tasks)

### Installation

1. **Clone and setup**:

```bash
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. **Environment setup**:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your database and API credentials
```

3. **Database setup**:

```bash
# The tables will be created automatically on startup
```

4. **Run the application**:

```bash
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

### Test the Deal Scout Agent

Run the test script to see the agent in action:

```bash
python test_deal_scout.py
```

This will demonstrate:

- Creating a grocery list
- Scouting deals across platforms
- Analyzing combo offers
- Comparing delivery times
- Generating recommendations

## üì° API Endpoints

### Grocery Management

- `POST /grocery/items` - Create grocery items
- `GET /grocery/items` - List grocery items (with category filter)
- `POST /grocery/lists` - Create grocery lists
- `GET /grocery/lists` - Get user's grocery lists
- `POST /grocery/lists/{id}/items` - Add items to list
- `GET /grocery/lists/{id}/items` - Get items in list

### Deal Scouting

- `POST /grocery/scout-deals` - Scout deals for a grocery list

- `GET /grocery/deals/{item_id}` - Get deals for specific item
- `POST /grocery/check-combo` - Check for combo offers
- `POST /grocery/compare-delivery` - Compare delivery times

## üîç How It Works

### 1. Platform Monitoring

The agent monitors 5 major grocery platforms:

- **Amazon Fresh**: 30-120 min delivery, ‚Çπ0 fee, ‚Çπ200 min order
- **Flipkart Supermart**: 45-180 min delivery, ‚Çπ40 fee, ‚Çπ150 min order
- **BigBasket**: 60-240 min delivery, ‚Çπ30 fee, ‚Çπ100 min order
- **Blinkit**: 10-30 min delivery, ‚Çπ20 fee, ‚Çπ50 min order
- **Swiggy Instamart**: 15-45 min delivery, ‚Çπ25 fee, ‚Çπ75 min order

### 2. Deal Analysis

For each grocery list, the agent:

- Fetches real-time prices from all platforms
- Calculates total costs including delivery fees
- Identifies combo deals and special offers
- Compares delivery times and costs
- Generates personalized recommendations

### 3. Smart Logic Examples

- **Combo Detection**: "Check if rice + milk combo has an offer"
- **Delivery Comparison**: "Check if Blinkit has faster delivery vs Amazon"
- **Savings Optimization**: Find the platform with maximum savings
- **Time vs Cost Trade-off**: Balance delivery speed with total cost

## üõ†Ô∏è Development

### Adding New Platforms

To add a new grocery platform:

1. Update the `platforms` dictionary in `DealScoutAgent.__init__()`
2. Implement platform-specific data fetching in `fetch_platform_data()`
3. Add platform-specific discount logic in `_generate_discount()`

### Extending Deal Logic

The agent supports various deal types:

- **Combo Deals**: Multiple items with combined discounts
- **Flash Sales**: Time-limited offers
- **Bulk Discounts**: Quantity-based savings
- **Platform-Specific Offers**: Unique deals per platform
